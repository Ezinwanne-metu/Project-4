        The year 2022 did not go as I expected. It is probably the worst year of my life. I stated this year with big plans, and a will to survive. Over the last three years, my job has both mentally and physically drained me and I couldn't do it anymore. Four days after my 30th birthday, I quit my job without a plan. This was on August 31st, 2022. Also, my account balance was flat red and I was almost homeless.

            Between September and November of 2022, I was home, alone and despressed. During this thime, the evil Yoruba man that has put me through hell for the past three years decided it was time for him to come back and finish what he started. This time around, I was done and done. It is quite unfortunate that I met another Yoruba man and went hrough the same shit all over again. <strong>PS: Yoruba men are from hell.</strong>

            I decided to carry out an extensive research on what else to do with my life and with the help of very dear family and friends, I found myself in the the TECH space. I stared learning HTML on October 27th, 2022 but I was getting distracted most times so I will stop for weeks then continue. Now, that I am in CSS learning phase, I am stuck, I need help. I want to stop but I can't. I need a mentor.

        <p>I ended the year 2022 the way I started it, <strong>completely broke!</strong></p>

        <p>By and large, I am using this page to practice what I have learnt in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>, and I am also going to upload on my Github account, just to see if I can still remeber whow I did it the last time. There is no going back.</p>
